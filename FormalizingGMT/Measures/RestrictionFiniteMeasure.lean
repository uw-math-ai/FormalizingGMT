# Regularity and approximation for restrictions of finite measure

This file proves regularity of a measure restricted to a set of finite measure, together with
closed inner approximations and open outer approximations of Carathéodory-measurable sets.

/-- **Restriction of a measure to a set of finite measure is regular.**
Let `X` be a locally compact, Hausdorff, second countable topological space equipped with its
Borel σ-algebra, let `μ` be a measure on `X`, and let `E ⊆ X` satisfy `μ E < ∞`.  Then the
restriction `μ.restrict E` belongs to Mathlib's class `MeasureTheory.Measure.Regular`, i.e. it is
outer regular by open sets and inner regular by compact sets on open (indeed, on finite-measure
measurable) sets. -/

/-- **Approximation of Carathéodory-measurable sets of finite measure by closed sets from
inside.**  Let `X` be a locally compact, Hausdorff, second countable topological space equipped
with its Borel σ-algebra and let `μ` be a measure on `X` (so that `μ`, viewed as an outer
measure, is Borel regular).  If `E ⊆ X` is Carathéodory measurable for `μ` with `μ E < ∞` and
`ε > 0`, then there is a closed set `F ⊆ E` with `μ (E \ F) < ε`.

/-- **Approximation of Carathéodory-measurable sets by open sets from outside.**
Let `X` be a locally compact, Hausdorff, second countable topological space equipped with its
Borel σ-algebra and let `μ` be a measure on `X`.  Let `E ⊆ X` be Carathéodory measurable for `μ`
with `μ E < ∞` and let `ε > 0`.  If there are open sets `V i` with `E ⊆ ⋃ i, V i` and
`μ (V i) < ∞` for all `i`, then there is an open set `F ⊇ E` with `μ (F \ E) < ε`.
